Command to create deployment
kubectl create deployment nginx-depl --image=nginx

to see deployment
kubectl get deployment

kubectl get all

kubectl get replicaset

If we create deployment, following things will be created automatically:

1. Replicaset: It will be created by deployment.
2. Pod: It will be created by the replicaset.

Command to edit deployment:
kubectl edit deployment nginx-depl

Note: deployments are brain of pod creation and replicaset creation.

We should always edit deployment for replicaset and pod

Create yaml manifest file:
Create deployment using kubernete manifest:

Creating services on kubernetes files:

1. Yaml files:
Develop yaml file in 2 parts
1. Deployment yaml
2. Service yaml

Yaml files has 3 parts

command to see the manifest files:
kubectl get deployment nginx-deployment -o yaml

Status part of YAML, its generated by kubernete.

Desired state : If we change the yaml file, kubernete scheduler runs continuously it sees the difference and apply.
It has self healing feature.

kubectl get service

see pod ip's

kubectl describe service nginx-service

kubectl get pod -o wide  (Getting detailed information about pod)
